You will use Java and have to apply Spring boot, Spring MVC, maven and git to finish this test project.
You will implement a RESTful service providing http get and http post methods which provide the exactly same function as below:
The service receives parameter inputStr which may include any kind of character
The service will handle the inputStr, respond and output the alphabet only characters with the original relative sequence, the highest frequent letter(s) and the number(s) of the letter(s) in the string.
The service will treat the capital letter and lowercase letter the same when counting the letter.
Sample input:   "as-dA@e32ar4As9"
Outpt: “The letters are: ‘asdAearAs’. The most frequent letter is ‘a’, and the frequency is 4”
